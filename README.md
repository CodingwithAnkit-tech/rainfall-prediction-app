# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Project

- Predicting whether it will rain tomorrow using Machine Learning.
- 
# 📌 Project Overview

- This project aims to predict Rainfall (Yes/No) using weather data.
- Since the output is binary, we use Logistic Regression, which is ideal for classification problems.
- The model is trained on important weather features such as:

- 🌡️ Temperature (Max & Min)

- 💧 Precipitation

- 🌬️ Wind Speed

The goal is to build a simple and accurate ML model that helps forecast rainfall.

# 🎯 Project Objective

- To analyze historical weather data
- To train a machine learning model
- To predict if it will rain the next day

- To deploy the model using Streamlit/GitHub/Railway (optional)

# 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
 
- Handled missing values
- Selected required numerical features
- Standardized data
- Split into Train/Test sets

- 2️⃣ Model Used

✔ Logistic Regression (Binary Classifier)
It works well because the target variable has only two classes: Rain or No Rain.

- 3️⃣ Evaluation

- Accuracy Score

- Confusion Matrix

- Classification Report

The model performs well for basic prediction on weather datasets.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Streamlit (for web app)
